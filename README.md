# Glints
Glints is a graphical tool for exploring (variant) narrowing computations in Maude.
Glints supports: 1) exploring variant narrowing trees, 2) checking the "finite variant property" (FVP) 
in equational theories, 3) checking equational embedding and closedness of 
variant narrowing trees modulo axioms, and 4) debugging Maude programs by querying and 
inspecting selected parts of the variant computations.

Glints has been implemented by Angel Cuenca-Ortega as a piece of his PhD Thesis: "Partial Evaluation of Rewriting Logic Theories", that he develops under the supervision of professors María Alpuente and Santiago Escobar.

Glints is a joint work developed by María Alpuente, Angel Cuenca-Ortega, Santiago Escobar, and Julia Sapiña.

FVP Checker
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FVP checker is part of the GLINTS project and allows to check finite variant property (FVP) property in 
equational theories. 

FVP-checker requires Maude or Mau-Dev (which is a developer extension of Maude 
available at http://safe-tools.dsic.upv.es/maudev) to run.

FVP checker is available at GLINTS website (safe-tools.dsic.upv.es/glints).
